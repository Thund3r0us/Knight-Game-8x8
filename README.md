# Knight-Game-8x8
Game assignment for CS2. 

We are going to play a fun strategy game that only requires two players! 
In this game, we have an 8 x 8 board and a Knight chess piece (that both players share) that starts on the top left of the board. 
Each player gets to move the Knight piece one square over either down, diagonal (bottom right direction only), 
or to the right of its current position (a player cannot move the piece two or more squares). 
The Knight piece can keep moving until it reaches the bottom right corner of the board. 
The respective player that moves the Knight to the bottom right corner of the board wins the game! 

In this assignment, I implemented the winning strategy for player 1 only.
